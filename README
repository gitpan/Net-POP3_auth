Abstract
--------

Net::POP3_auth is a small extension to G. Barr's Net::POP3

methods APOP, CRAM-MD5 or PLAIN. This module can be expanded and 
is a very first implementation.

------------

------------

This module requires:
 
   - Net::POP3 (should be obvious)
   - MIME::Base64
   - Digest::HMAC_MD5

The requirements are encoded in Makefile.PL.  

------------------

-------------------

Net::POP3_auth can also be installed manually.
