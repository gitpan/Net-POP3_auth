Note: This version requires Authen::SASL. If you want to want to go
without, use version Net::POP3_auth 0.02.

Can someone please provide me with a SMTP account on a 
maschine using DIGEST-MD5 or NTLM for testing?

--------
Abstract
--------

Net::POP3_auth is a small extension to G. Barr's Net::POP3
to authenticate to an POP3 server using one of the AUTH
methods APOP and SASL (Authen::SASL). This module can be expanded 
and is a very first implementation.

------------
Requirements
------------

This module requires:
 
   - Net::POP3 (should be obvious)
   - MIME::Base64
   - Digest::HMAC_MD5
   - Authen::SASL

The requirements are encoded in Makefile.PL.  

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

Net::POP3_auth may be installed through the CPAN shell in the
usual CPAN shell manner.  This typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::POP3_auth'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme Net::POP3_auth

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install Net::POP3_auth

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

Net::POP3_auth can also be installed manually.  

Download the package from:
http://alex.zeitform.de/smtp_auth/

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.
